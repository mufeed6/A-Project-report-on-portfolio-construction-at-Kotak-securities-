# Data Analysis of A-Project-report-on-portfolio-construction-at-Kotak-securities-

#Findings

The study on portfolio management makes me understand and learn many things. The
findings of the study are:
 Among the individual stock calculations, Lupin is a better stock with a return of 7.13%
and risk of 7.17 and beta of -0.41. In terms of return, HDFC is less than lupin with a
return of 2.90, but the risk is less than lupin with 5.22, which is low and with a beta of
1.13. So, HDFC is not a good option for investors to invest.
 On portfolio construction, 96% of TCS & 6% of Lupin were found as an optimum
portfolio as per Sharpe‘s method.
 Finally, the noticing thing is that a portfolio with Lupin is well performed.

#Suggestion:

As per the Study, it is suggested that based on the year of analysis, If any investor
have invested their money in a combination of TCS to the extent of 96% of their
money & other 6% of the money in Lupin limited, he/she would have earned
maximum returns from the portfolio possibilities out of all the combinations possible
with these five identifies companies.

It is also suggested that any portfolio decision should not be based fully out of any
one method of calculation as it is too risky and hence only with the concurrence of
inputs from other type of portfolio assessments along with Sharpe‘s an ideal
investment decision should be taken.

#Conclusion:

On behave of the portfolio management study we can conclude that: The aim and objectives
of the study has been achieved and also it‘s worth reiterating that not to put all your trust in
only one investment. It is like ―putting all the eggs in one basket‖ This will help to reduce the
risk in the long-term. The investors are benefited by investing in selected scripts of Industries
of if the investment decisions are informed ones. Models like Sharpe‘s & Markowitz's would
play a great role in facilitating such investor information systems.

#“Greater Portfolio Return with less Risk is always is an attractive combination” for the
Investors.
